You'll start by learning how to set up your Node development environment, including loading the community-created extensions. Next, you'll run several simple demonstration programs where you'll learn the basics of a few common types of Node applications. Then you'll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.",

The book teaches the basic conceptions of Node.js, frameworks that are used for creating Node.js apps, web applications. \nWhat I think could be better: \n1. More details about Node.js (child processes, creating custom modules).\n 2. The chapters where we create a photo app using Express would be more structured and easier to follow. I would like to be able to download work in progress code from the book website.",
